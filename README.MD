# What is Hammy?
`Hammy` is a morse code turned ASK that you can use for radios... or anything, really. My lack of documentation
Has led to a problematic lack of understanding the code, so mantenance or improvement without completely starting again with a new project is unlikely.

# Installation
The requirements.txt has the packages necessary for installation, however, the `python3 dev` and `portaudio dev`
(exact naming will vary by system) must be installed prior to installation. However, after the installation,
feel free to remove the packages. (this is not necessary on windows as far as I am aware.)
